Deep Learning Introduction:
1. Deep Learning in defines about to working on complex neural networks. This  topoc is subset of the Machine Learning.

Types of layers in Deep Learning:
1. Input Layer:
Recieve the raw data of the machine
2. Hidden Layer:
Perform the computations in the hidden layer which is process the data
3. Out Layer:
Provide the final output and prediction on classification

Activation functions in Deep Learning:
1. ReLu: Rectified Liner Unit:
which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simply used to speed up during the training of the data.
2. sigmoid:
map the values binary (0 and 1 in the layer).
3. softmax:
convert the raw data (score) convert into the probability on the given data.

Back popogation and optimisation:
In this propogation step we use of the example:- mse(means standard error), cross entropy stop: which are optimises the data.
